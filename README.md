My name is Tuong Vy, I am a student majoring in Technology and Innovation. After being exposed to many subjects and various types of technology, I realized that the role of data is extremely important, which motivated me to become a data analyst to discover the hidden value behind thousands of rows of data and visualize it into beautiful animated charts. Through this, I have self-taught extensively about SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau. Here is my entire learning journey to become a true data analyst.

I hope to apply my knowledge to help businesses make effective strategic decisions and accompany them in their company development process.
